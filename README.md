## 🧠 Verification Logic

The system uses a **serverless verification engine** deployed on Supabase Edge Functions.

---

### 1️⃣ Coursera Certificate Validation

- Certificate page fetched via HTTP request (Edge Function)
- Student name extracted using multiple strategies:
  - "Completed by <Student Name>" text pattern
  - Open Graph (og:description) meta tags
  - JSON-LD structured data
  - HTML data attributes
- No fallback extraction
- Missing pattern → Verification fails

---

### 2️⃣ LinkedIn Post Validation

- LinkedIn page content is parsed from URL structure
- Username extracted from LinkedIn URL path
- Identity normalized

---

### 3️⃣ Identity Matching

Compares:
- Logged-in student name
- Coursera certificate name
- LinkedIn username

Using:
- ✔ Case-insensitive normalization
- ✔ Levenshtein distance algorithm (Custom TypeScript implementation)
- ✔ Token sort ratio for fuzzier matching

---

### 4️⃣ Course / Project Matching

Compares:
- Coursera course title
- LinkedIn caption / hashtags (if available/extractable)

---

### 5️⃣ Decision Logic

| Condition | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Student Match = Yes AND Course Match = Yes | ✅ Correct |
| Else | ❌ Wrong |

---

## ⚙️ Processing & Stability Mechanisms

Each submission:

✔ Processed asynchronously via Edge Functions
✔ Hard timeout protection
✔ Failure-safe termination

Possible terminal states:
- Correct
- Wrong
- Skipped (Timeout)
- Failed (Error)

❌ No infinite "Processing"

---

## 📊 Leaderboard System

Dynamic leaderboard filtered by college.

Ranking based on:
1. Highest Score
2. Submission activity

Scoring:
- Correct Submission → +10 points
- Wrong / Failed → 0 points

---

## 📈 Marks Calculation Logic

Marks computed as:
`Marks = floor(Number_of_Submissions / 3)`

---

## 📦 Admin Export Report

Generated Excel includes:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Student Name | Verified student |
| Roll Number | Unique identifier |
| Number of Submissions | Count per student |
| Marks | floor(submissions / 3) |
